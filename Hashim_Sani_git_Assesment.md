### GIT submission review report
Reviewer : Slah Sani

Original author : Muhammad Hashim



Submission covers almost all the needed commands to deal with GIT.

HEAD command
Probably he can try HEAD command as well. It is a useful command to move through the commit tree. HEAD pointer keeps moving and in majority of the cases it refers to the most recent commit.

useful command I learned from Submission
"git tag" command was missing in my submission. I learned it while reviewing Hashim's submission.

git pull  & git fetch
"pull" and "fetch" were confusing for me. Submission prompted me to learn more about "pull" command.
* git pull = git fetch + git merge

I also learned many new commands during review. For example rebase, tag, git push -u etc

Javascript based web tool  https://learngitbranching.js.org/ is a more visual and interactive way to learn git. It helped me more to properly understand all the commands.
